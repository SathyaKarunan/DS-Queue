451. Sort Characters By Frequency

Given a string s, sort it in decreasing order based on the frequency of the characters. The frequency of a character is the number of times it appears in the string.

Return the sorted string. If there are multiple answers, return any of them.

 
Example 1:

Input: s = "tree"
Output: "eert"
Explanation: 'e' appears twice while 'r' and 't' both appear once.
So 'e' must appear before both 'r' and 't'. Therefore "eetr" is also a valid answer.
Example 2:

Input: s = "cccaaa"
Output: "aaaccc"
Explanation: Both 'c' and 'a' appear three times, so both "cccaaa" and "aaaccc" are valid answers.
Note that "cacaca" is incorrect, as the same characters must be together.
Example 3:

Input: s = "Aabb"
Output: "bbAa"
Explanation: "bbaA" is also a valid answer, but "Aabb" is incorrect.
Note that 'A' and 'a' are treated as two different characters.
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 5 * 105
s consists of uppercase and lowercase English letters and digits.


Approach:
1)Use map to count frequency
2)Use priority queue(max heap) to sort the frequenecy of char
3)Finally traverse it and append to resultant string

Code1:

class Solution {
public:
    string frequencySort(string s) {
    int n=s.size();
    unordered_map<char,int>mp;
    for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
    mp[s[i]]++;
    }
    string ans="";
    priority_queue<pair<int,char>>pq;
    for(auto i:mp){
    pq.push({i.second,i.first});
    }
    while(!pq.empty()){
    pair<int,char>p=pq.top();
    pq.pop();
    while(p.first--){
        ans+=p.second;
    }
    }
    return ans;
    }
};

Code2:
Solution II - Using Bucket Sort
First, we count the frequency of each letter using unordered_map freq.
Then, we use a vector to store buckets by the frequency. In each bucket we have a vector of the chars with that frequency.
Constructing the result is simply looping the buckets from the end - to get the higher frequencies first, and adding the chars in the current frequency.

class Solution {
public:
    string frequencySort(string s) {
        unordered_map<char, int> freq;
        for (auto a : s) freq[a]++;
        
        vector<vector<char>> buckets(s.size()+1);
        for (auto [a, frq] : freq) buckets[frq].push_back(a);
        
        string res;
        for (int i = s.size(); i > 0; i--) {
            for (auto ch : buckets[i]) {
                res += string(i, ch);
            }
        }
        
        return res;
    }
};
